<p><b>Sentence Judgment Survey</b></p>

<p class="block-text">In this task, you will help us train an automated system that tries to tell whether English sentences sound like they were produced by a real English speaker. You will see a sequence of 52 sentences and tell us how natural these sentences sound to you. </p>

<p class="block-text">The HIT should take about 5 minutes to complete.</p>

<p><b>Instructions</b></p>

	<p class="block-text" id="blurb1">For each sentence, you should indicate how natural the sentence sounds to you. You will answer using a 7-point scale where 1 means that the statement is completely unnatural and 7 means that the statement is completely natural.</p>
	
	<p class="block-text" id="blurb2"> Your answer should reflect what a real English speaker might say, even if it violates certain grammar rules that you learned in school. Try to use the entire scale throughout the task.</p>
	
	<p class="block-text" id="blurb3">You will begin by seeing 4 warm-up sentences, for which you will receive feedback. After this, you will see a sequence of 48 sentences, for which you will see no feedback. </p>
